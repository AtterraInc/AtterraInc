- 👋 Hi, I’m @AtterraInc
- 👀 I’m interested in building products to help, well me.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything I can so I understand how things work.  It's a bit exhausting.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making something that I can use for my business and iterate upon to increase productivity. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Chris@atterra.ai
- ⚡ Fun fact: I saw an albino racoon on a jog one morning in Oakland, CA.
